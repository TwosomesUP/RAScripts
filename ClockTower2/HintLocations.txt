1.6 - H I N T S
------------------------------------------------------------------>

Here you will find all the hints in the game and their locations, 
just incase you feel like picking them up in the game for some odd 
reason. I have also added some thoughts or details on some of them
as there are some odd things with some of them. 


Hint 1 - 
Scenario - One
Location (Object, Room) - Washing Machine, Bathroom

Alyssa and Bates encounter different events. If you find yourself
unable to continue, first change personalities by putting down the
amulet and then try again.


Hint 2 - 
Scenario - One
Location (Object, Room) -  Kitchen Sink, Kitchen (of all places :-P)

There are some events that Alyssa can clear only when she has put
down the amulet. Put down the amulet and try again. 

(Is it me or does this just sound like Hint 1 reworded?)


Hint 3 - 
Scenario - One
Location (Object, Room) - Coffee Table, Living Room 2F

After saving Aunt Kathryn from Stephanie, lock Stephanie in the 
bedroom. Since one particular item has not been expended, you should
be able to use it here.

(You will only get this if you have done everything correctly for 
the A ending. The item is the bedroom key.)


Hint 4 - 
Scenario - One
Location (Object, Room) - Books, Hallway 1F

When confronting Stephanie in front of the fireplace, drop the amulet.
Be sure to pick it up again.

(You will only get this hint if you are doing poorly in the game.
Doing such things as talking to Phillip as Bates in the Entryway
or going for a very low rank ending will cause it to appear.)


Hint 5 - 
Scenario - Two
Location (Object, Room) - Nightstand, Room 102

If you do not see all of the events in "Noisy Monster Cage" you
will not be able to escape from the hospital.


Hint 6 - 
Scenario - Two
Location (Object, Room) - Bookshelf, Office 3

Head Nurse Cook and Reporter Bowman appear in "Noisy Monster Cage"
But they also appear in "The Fathers"


Hint 7 - 
Scenario - Three
Location (Object, Room) - Computer, Office 2

The armored samurai will sometimes move, while other times he will
not. Whether he moves or not plays a major factor in determining 
the ending.

(This is very misleading. It sounds as though you don't need to 
check this for each play through and that it relies on luck. In
actual fact, only one ending requires it not to be moved, and in
all the others you can basically look at it anytime)


Hint 8 - 
Scenario - Three
Location (Object, Room) - Computer, Lab 2

Sorry, no hints this time! Help Alyssa as best you can!

(What is the point of having this 8th Hint? An even number or 
something?)
