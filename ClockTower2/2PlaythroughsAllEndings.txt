By saving at the right times the game can be played so that you
will only need to play through twice to get all the endings. 
Here is the list of places where to save to get the endings on
2 play throughs. For the actual details see the above A ending 
guide. This is the full path you should follow with the following
exceptions to get all the endings. 

==========================

- Play from the start to until when you have to put the amulet in
  the vase. Save. Don't put the amulet down. Get the M ending and
  reload your save.
- Continue until you come out of the bedroom while Stephanie is in
  it. Save. Leaving the door unlocked will allow you to get the L
  ending. Reload your save.
- Continue on again until before you get the key from Philip. Save
  and go to him as Bates. Get the K ending. Reload your save and
  continue.
- When you get to the point of meeting Philip in the basement den
  save beforehand then go there as Bates. This will get you the J
  ending. Load your save.
- When it comes time to burn the statue, save before the scene. To
  get the I ending don't reach for the amulet when you have the 
  chance. Reload after getting the ending and finish this chapter.
  
==========================
 
- Finish the 2nd chapter (there are no endings during it).

==========================

- Play through the 3rd chapter until just before you meet Shannon.
  Save. Change into Bates and talk to her. Ending H. Reload.
- In the A guide where it tells you to pick the amulet back up
  from the room where Shannon was. Save and don't pick it up.
  When you get the Lab Key, use it. Enter the lab as Bates and
  Maxwell will kill you. Ending F. 
- Reload that last save and again don't pick up the amulet.  
  Continue on as normal. You will pick up the knife instead of 
  the storage key. Use the knife to cut the rope on the door and
  talk to Allen. Ending E. Reload same save again.
- This time pick up the amulet and continue to follow the game
  guide. When you get to the basement labs, save the game. Enter
  the room where Shannon is with the Amulet still on you to get
  the D ending. Reload the save and continue.
- Before you get to the scene with Doug Bowman asking you if you
  want to leave, save. When he asks say YES. Ending C. Reload the
  save and continue by saying NO.
- Again before you get to the scene where Alex Corey asks you if
  you want to leave, save. When he asks say YES. Ending B. Reload
  the save and continue by saying NO.
- Finish the game to get ending A.

===========================
DON'T MOVE SAMURAI
===========================

- To get the last ending you need, the G ending, start a new game.
  When you get to the point of moving the samurai, DON'T. Instead
  leave it. When you get to the 3rd Chapter, you will find you can
  only get into the courtyard on the 1st floor. By getting the key
  on the ground ther you will get the G ending.

There you have it, all 13 endings on 2 play throughs.
