Good... {{This new 'Shinano' ship is really
something...

transfer to the space army...

Wh-what's that?!

Confirmed: Spaceship ahead, likely
originating from the 3rd plant.

[Officer Brahwell]

Hmm, so those pathetic humans have
found their way into space as well...

What should we do, Majesty?

They obstruct my view... 
Eliminate them!!

Yes!

Prepare to fire the front lasers!

=============

From within the ruins,		0
Brahwell awakened and		1
revealed a terrible truth.  2
This otherworldly space		3
was a trap for Ellinor.		4

When Ellinor defeated		6
Brahwell, the world			7
vanished, but three days	8
had passed on Earth.		9

Hurry, Ellinor-				11
The Earth is in danger!!	12

=====  

Though her friends cheered,    0
Ellinor's heart was heavy.     1
Brahwell was gone, but Earth   2
had been destroyed. Alone,     3     
she laid flowers by the surf   4
for her father. Nearby, a      5
Rosa slips into the dusk.      6
The story may not be over...   7

Meanwhile, by sheer will,      9 
Ray came from across the       10
sea, riding a whale.           11     
(What a guy, that Ray...)      12
